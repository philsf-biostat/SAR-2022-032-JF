# Context

In **SAR-2021-002-JF-v02** the average survival time of knee implants was estimated.
After that retrospective cohort was analyzed, aggregated counts of previous surgery were made available, and this analysis will investigate whether or not this exposure is a significant risk factor for loosening.

## Objectives

Calculate the prevalence of knee prosthesis loosening in patients with prior history of knee surgery in Helios Klinikum Berlin-Buch, Germany.

## Data reception and cleaning

The original data was already aggregated into counts of exposure and outcome.
No individual information was available on these patients (see Observations).

# Methods

The methods of this analysis are fully described in the annex document
**SAP-2022-032-JF-v01**.

<!-- ## Study parameters -->

<!-- ### Study design -->

<!-- ### Inclusion and exclusion criteria -->

<!-- ### Exposures -->

<!-- ### Outcomes -->

<!-- ### Covariates -->

<!-- ## Statistical analyses -->

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.

# Results

<!-- ## Study population and follow up -->

There were 20 loosening events in total in the study sample (Table 1).
The prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 25.7% (9 out of 35), while among unexposed it was 15.7% (11 out of 70).

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  kable(
    # colnames = c(" ", "Loosening", "No loosening", "Total"),
    caption = "**Table 1** caption"
  )
```

```{r fig1, fig.cap="**Figure 1** caption"}

# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/outcome.png", error = FALSE)
```

The prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery

- prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 25.7%, while among unexposed it was 15.7%.
- The outcome prevalence among the exposed was 1.64 (95% CI 0.75 to 3.58) times greater than the outcome prevalence among the unexposed. 

<!-- ## Inferential analysis -->

The odds of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 1.86 (95% CI 0.69 to 5.02) times greater than the outcome odds among the unexposed.
This means that, starting from the cases and analyzing the retrospective risk factor, the chance of patients that experienced the outcome also having had a prior surgery is 86% higher than the controls.
Since the CI includes the OR = 1, then the OR is not significant (chi-square test: p = 0.219).

The attributable fraction in the exposed is 45.8%.
This means that 45.8% of outcomes in the exposed were attributable to exposure (95% CI -67.3% to 82.1%).

- odds of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 1.86 (95% CI 0.69 to 5.02) times greater than the outcome odds among the unexposed. 
- 45.8% of outcomes in the exposed were attributable to exposure (95% CI -67.3% to 82.1%).

# Observations and Limitations

**Aggregated sample data**

No individual-level data was available for this analysis.
This means that we cannot control for confounding either in regression models or stratified analyses.
It is recommended that this be reported as a limitation of the study, since it raises the risk of bias of the study.

**Recommended reporting guideline**

The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals.
All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014).

In particular when a retrospective study is conducted using hospital records, it is recommended that the RECORD extension of the STROBE guideline is considered (Benchimol et al, 2015).

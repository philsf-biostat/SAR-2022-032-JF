## Statistical analyses

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  kable(
    # colnames = c(" ", "Loosening", "No loosening", "Total"),
    caption = "**Table 1** caption"
  )
```

```{r fig1, fig.cap="**Figure 1** caption"}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
# knitr::include_graphics("../figures/outcome.png", error = FALSE)
```

The prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery

- prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 25.7%, while among unexposed it was 15.7%.
- The outcome prevalence among the exposed was 1.64 (95% CI 0.75 to 3.58) times greater than the outcome prevalence among the unexposed. 

## Inferential analysis

- odds of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 1.86 (95% CI 0.69 to 5.02) times greater than the outcome odds among the unexposed. 
- 45.8% of outcomes in the exposed were attributable to exposure (95% CI -67.3% to 82.1%).

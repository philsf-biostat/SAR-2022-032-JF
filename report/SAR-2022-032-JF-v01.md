# Abbreviations

# Context

In **SAR-2021-002-JF-v02** the average survival time of knee implants was estimated.
After that retrospective cohort was analyzed, aggregated counts of previous surgery were made available, and this analysis will investigate whether or not this exposure is a significant risk factor for loosening.

## Objectives

Calculate the prevalence of knee prosthesis loosening in patients with prior history of knee surgery in Helios Klinikum Berlin-Buch, Germany.

## Data reception and cleaning

The original data was already aggregated into counts of exposure and outcome.
No individual information was available on these patients (see Observations).

# Methods

The methods of this analysis are fully described in the annex document
**SAP-2022-032-JF-v01**.

<!-- ## Statistical analyses -->

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version 4.2.1.

# Results

## Study population and follow up


Table: **Table 1** caption

|                 | Loosening| No loosening| Total|
|:----------------|---------:|------------:|-----:|
|Prior surgery    |         9|           26|    35|
|No prior surgery |        11|           59|    70|
|Total            |        20|           85|   105|



The prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery

- prevalence of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 25.7%, while among unexposed it was 15.7%.
- The outcome prevalence among the exposed was 1.64 (95% CI 0.75 to 3.58) times greater than the outcome prevalence among the unexposed. 

## Inferential analysis

- odds of loosening among patients exposed to prior surgery was 1.86 (95% CI 0.69 to 5.02) times greater than the outcome odds among the unexposed. 
- 45.8% of outcomes in the exposed were attributable to exposure (95% CI -67.3% to 82.1%).



# Observations and Limitations

**Aggregated sample data**

No individual-level data was available for this analysis.
This means that we cannot control for confounding either in regression models or stratified analyses.
It is recommended that this be reported as a limitation of the study, since it raises the risk of bias of the study.

**Recommended reporting guideline**

The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals.
All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014).

In particular when a retrospective study is conducted using hospital records, it is recommended that the RECORD extension of the STROBE guideline is considered (Benchimol et al, 2015).
